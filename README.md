# httpc
This is a httpc dynamic library wrapped in C++.
If you donâ€™t care about the content of the http response, and just want to know if the request was sent successfully, then you can try using it.
get and post are supported.

# Usage
```lua
local httpc = require "httpc"

-- Start a libcurl client managed by epoll.
-- Success will return 0.
local result = httpc.start("epoll")
print("start :", result)

-- Send an https request.
local url = "https://example.com/"
-- Discard the response content.
local lose_content = true
result = httpc.request(url, lose_content)
print("request : ", result)

while true do
	-- Timed refresh
	httpc.flush()
	-- Get the error messages of all failed requests.
	local list = httpc.failed()
	-- sleep 100 ms
	httpc.sleep(100)
end
```
